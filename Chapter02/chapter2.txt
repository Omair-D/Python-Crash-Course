try it yourself

 Save each of the following exercises as a separate file with a name like  
name_cases.py. If you get stuck, take a break or see the suggestions in 
Appendix C.
  
 2-3. Personal Message: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print 
a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, 
would you like to learn some Python today?”
  
 2-4. Name Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print 
that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.
  
 2-5. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the 
quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the 
following, including the quotation marks:
 Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a 
mistake never tried anything new.”
  
 2-6. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the 
famous person’s name using a variable called famous_person. Then compose 
your  message and represent it with a new variable called message. Print your 
message.
  
 2-7. Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include 
some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure 
you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
 Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), 
rstrip(), and strip()

2-8. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations 
in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
 print(5+3)
 Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once 
on each line.

 2-9. Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, 
using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print 
that message.
